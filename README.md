**Clustering:**
The nuclei were clustered based on the 2,000 highly variable genes using [desc](https://github.com/eleozzr/desc).We used two hidden layers for encoder with 256 nodes in the first layer 
and 128 nodes in the second layer.To identify an optimal resolution parameter, we performed the DESC analysis 15 times 
using different resolutions ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 with an incremental 0.05 step.

**Microglia recluster:**
To identify microglia subpopulations, microglia cells was re-clustered by [desc](https://github.com/eleozzr/desc). We 
selected 5,000 highly variable genes in order to detect subtle cellular differences among the 
microglia. A single 128-node layer was applied for the encoder in DESC and the resolutions 
ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 with an incremental 0.05 increasing step.
